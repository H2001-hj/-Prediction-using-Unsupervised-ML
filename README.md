# -Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML
As a Business Analytics and Data Science Intern in GRIP at The Sparks Foundation we were given the task of Prediction using Unsupervised ML.  OBJECTIVE:-Clustering of Iris Dataset  From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.  ALGORITHM USED:- K-Means  K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.
